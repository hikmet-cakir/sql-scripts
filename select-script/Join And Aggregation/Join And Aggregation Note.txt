-- Joins 
-- Produces values by merging together rows from different related tables
-- Use a join most times that you're asked to find data involves multiple resources



-- Aggregation
-- Looks at many rows and calculates a single value
-- Words like 'most', 'average', 'least' are a sign that you need to use an aggregation.



Notes on Joins

- Table order between 'FROM' and 'JOIN' frequently makes a difference
- We  must give context if column names collide
- Tables can be renamed using the 'AS' keyword
- There are a few kinds of joins!
